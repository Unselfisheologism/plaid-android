MyAgenticBrowser GitHub Actions Usage Guide
=========================================

This guide explains how to use GitHub Actions to build the MyAgenticBrowser APK without installing Android Studio.

Prerequisites:
1. A GitHub account
2. This repository forked to your GitHub account

Steps to build the APK using GitHub Actions:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account:
   - Go to the original repository page
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
   - Select your account as the destination

2. Navigate to the Actions tab in your forked repository:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub
   - Click on the "Actions" tab

3. Select a workflow to run:
   - You should see several workflows:
     * "Build Debug APK" - Builds a debug APK for testing
     * "Build All APKs" - Builds both debug and release APKs
     * "Build Signed APK" - Builds a signed release APK (requires setup)

4. Run a workflow:
   - Click on the workflow you want to run (e.g., "Build Debug APK")
   - Click the "Run workflow" button
   - Select the branch (usually "main" or "master")
   - Click "Run workflow" again

5. Wait for the workflow to complete:
   - The workflow will take 5-10 minutes to complete
   - You can watch the progress in real-time

6. Download the APK:
   - Once the workflow completes, click on the completed run
   - Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section
   - Click on the artifact you want to download (e.g., "debug-apk")
   - Save the ZIP file to your computer
   - Extract the ZIP file to get the APK

7. Install the APK on your Android device:
   - Transfer the APK file to your Android device
   - On your Android device, locate the APK file and tap on it
   - If prompted, enable "Install from unknown sources" in your device settings
   - Follow the prompts to install the app

Alternative: Using the trigger script

If you prefer to trigger the workflow from your local machine:

1. Install Python 3 if you don't have it already
2. Run the trigger script:
   - On Windows: double-click "trigger_github_action.bat"
   - On macOS/Linux: run "./trigger_github_action.sh" in terminal
3. Enter your GitHub username, repository name, and personal access token when prompted
4. The script will trigger the workflow and provide a link to monitor progress

Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give the token a name (e.g., "MyAgenticBrowser Actions")
4. Select the "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and save it securely (you won't see it again)

Monitoring Builds:

- Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
- Click on a workflow run to see detailed logs
- Check the "Artifacts" section for downloadable APKs

Troubleshooting:

- If the workflow fails, check the logs for error messages
- Make sure all required secrets are set for signed builds
- Ensure your repository has the correct structure and files
- Check that the ANDROID_HOME environment variable is set correctly in the workflow
