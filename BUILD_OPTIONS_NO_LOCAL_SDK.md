## Overview

If you don't want to install the Android SDK locally (which requires setting up ANDROID_HOME and takes up significant disk space), you have several alternatives:

1. Use GitHub Actions to build the APK in the cloud
2. Use alternative online build services
3. Use Docker containers with pre-configured Android build environments

This document focuses on the GitHub Actions method, which is free for public repositories and requires minimal setup.

## GitHub Actions Method (Recommended)

### Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. This repository forked to your GitHub account
3. A GitHub Personal Access Token (for triggering workflows via script)

### Steps

#### Option 1: Manual GitHub Actions Trigger

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account:
   - Go to the original repository page
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
   - Select your account as the destination

2. **Navigate to the Actions tab** in your forked repository:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub
   - Click on the "Actions" tab
   - If prompted, enable GitHub Actions for your repository

3. **Select and run a workflow**:
   - You should see several workflows:
     * "Build Debug APK" - Builds a debug APK for testing
     * "Build All APKs" - Builds both debug and release APKs
     * "Build Signed APK" - Builds a signed release APK (requires setup)
   - Click on the workflow you want to run (e.g., "Build Debug APK")
   - Click the "Run workflow" button
   - Select the branch (usually "main" or "master")
   - Click "Run workflow" again

4. **Wait for the workflow to complete**:
   - The workflow will take 5-10 minutes to complete
   - You can watch the progress in real-time

5. **Download the APK**:
   - Once the workflow completes, click on the completed run
   - Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section
   - Click on the artifact you want to download (e.g., "debug-apk")
   - Save the ZIP file to your computer
   - Extract the ZIP file to get the APK

6. **Install the APK on your Android device**:
   - Transfer the APK file to your Android device
   - On your Android device, locate the APK file and tap on it
   - If prompted, enable "Install from unknown sources" in your device settings
   - Follow the prompts to install the app

#### Option 2: Using the Trigger Script

If you prefer to trigger the workflow from your local machine:

1. **Install Python 3** if you don't have it already
2. **Run the trigger script**:
   - On Windows: double-click "trigger_github_action.bat"
   - On macOS/Linux: run "./trigger_github_action.sh" in terminal
3. **Enter your GitHub username, repository name, and personal access token** when prompted
4. The script will trigger the workflow and provide a link to monitor progress

##### Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give the token a name (e.g., "MyAgenticBrowser Actions")
4. Select the "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and save it securely (you won't see it again)

## Alternative Online Build Services

### 1. GitHub Codespaces

1. Create a GitHub Codespace for your repository
2. The environment comes pre-configured with Android SDK
3. Build using the provided scripts

### 2. GitPod

1. Open your repository in GitPod
2. Use the terminal to run Gradle build commands

## Alternatives to Local Android SDK Setup

Setting up the Android SDK locally requires installing Android Studio, setting up the ANDROID_HOME environment variable, and downloading various SDK components which can take up several GBs of disk space. Here are the alternatives we've implemented and recommend for building MyAgenticBrowser APK without local SDK setup:

### 1. GitHub Actions (Recommended)

GitHub Actions provides a cloud-based build environment with pre-configured Android SDK and tools. This approach requires no local setup and provides consistent builds across all environments. The workflows handle all the necessary setup automatically, including Java, Android SDK, and Gradle configuration. This is the most straightforward option for building the APK without any local Android development tools installed.


### 2. GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a complete development environment in the cloud with the Android SDK pre-installed. You can directly build and test your application without any local setup. This is useful if you need to make modifications to the code before building the APK.


### 3. GitPod

GitPod offers an online IDE with pre-configured development environments. You can open the repository in GitPod and build the APK using the command line tools directly in the browser-based IDE.


## Fixes Applied to GitHub Actions Workflows

We've updated all GitHub Actions workflows to fix the deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` issue, which was causing workflow failures. The updated workflows now use the current `actions/upload-artifact@v4` action to ensure proper functionality.


### Updated Workflows

1. **`.github/workflows/build-all-apks.yml`**
   - Changed `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

2. **`.github/workflows/build-debug-apk.yml`**
   - Changed `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

3. **`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`**
   - Changed `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

4. **`.github/workflows/build-signed-apk.yml`**
   - Changed `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

### Why This Fix Was Needed

The `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action has been deprecated and is no longer supported. Using it would cause workflow failures with error messages indicating that the action is no longer available. The update to `v4` ensures workflows continue to function properly and can successfully upload the built APKs as artifacts for download. This fix allows you to build the APK using GitHub Actions without encountering the deprecated action error you experienced.


## Additional GitHub Actions Fixes

In addition to updating the deprecated upload action, we've also fixed an issue with the gradlew script that was causing parsing errors in the Linux environment of GitHub Actions. The error looked like this:


```
./gradlew: 2: eval: -Xms64m: not found
./gradlew: 138: die: not found
./gradlew: 140: exec: : Permission denied
```

This error occurred because the gradlew script had Windows line endings (CRLF) instead of Unix line endings (LF). We've updated all workflow files to include a step that fixes line endings using the `dos2unix` command before executing the gradlew script. This ensures the script runs properly in the Linux environment of GitHub Actions.

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails

- Check the logs in the workflow run for specific error messages
- Common issues:
  - Missing dependencies in `build.gradle`
  - Incorrect Java/Gradle versions
  - Network issues during dependency downloads

### APK Not Found

- Make sure the workflow completed successfully
- Check that the correct path is specified in the `upload-artifact` step
- Verify that the APK was actually built by checking the build logs

### GitHub Actions Not Enabled

- Make sure GitHub Actions is enabled for your repository
- Go to Settings → Actions → General and ensure actions are enabled

### Workflow Permissions

- Ensure your repository has sufficient permissions to run GitHub Actions
- For private repositories, check your GitHub plan supports GitHub Actions

## Benefits of Using GitHub Actions

1. **No Local Setup Required**: No need to install Android Studio, JDK, or Gradle
2. **Consistent Builds**: All builds happen in the same environment
3. **Automated Testing**: Can integrate automated tests into the workflow
4. **Easy Distribution**: Artifacts are automatically uploaded and available for download
5. **Version Control**: All build configurations are version-controlled with your code
6. **Free Tier**: GitHub provides free minutes for public repositories

## Security Considerations

1. **Signing Secrets**: Never commit keystore files or passwords to the repository
2. **Environment Variables**: Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
3. **Artifact Access**: Only repository collaborators can download artifacts by default
4. **Workflow Permissions**: Review and limit workflow permissions as needed
